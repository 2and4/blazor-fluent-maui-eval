# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies for the native applications. These applications are either unsigned or signed with a developer certificate. It is highly recommended that they be used in a safe or sandboxed environment.

## Usage Recommendations
To ensure the safety and security of systems, please follow these recommendations:
- **Sandbox Environment**: Run the native applications in a virtual machine or sandbox environment. This minimizes the risk to the main system and ensures any potential issues are contained.
- **Safe Environment**: Use the native applications in a controlled, safe environment where behavior and impact can be monitored.

## User Data
- **Data Collection and Sharing**: No user data is collected or shared with third parties.
